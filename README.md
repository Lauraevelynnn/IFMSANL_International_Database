# üåê IFMSA-NL International Database

### Hello, world! üåç
I'm Laura, the NMO-P of IFMSA-NL 23/24, and I created the International Database to help our amazing volunteers easily access and use the opportunities IFMSA offers. As a beginner coder, my code might not be perfect, but it works and gets the job done! üöÄ

## Quick Overview
This program does some cool things:
1. üìß Scans your Gmail for relevant opportunities.
2. üóìÔ∏è Extracts deadline and a summary of the opportunity
3. üìÑ Converts emails into PDFs.
4. üìä Uploads the details to a Google Sheet for easy reference.
5. üì≤ Sends these PDFs,  via WhatsApp.

To make things even better, the program uses local AI to summarize emails, ensuring privacy and minimal environmental impact, no ChatGPT or Llama found here.

## Setup Instructions
I've recorded a detailed video guide for you (which you can find [here]()), but here‚Äôs a quick rundown:

### Step 1: Enable Necessary APIs
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/apis/credentials?supportedpurview=project) and create a project.
2. Enable the Gmail API, Google Drive API, and Google Sheets API.

### Step 2: Set Up Gmail API Credentials
1. Visit the [credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=peppy-goods-422010-e6&supportedpurview=project) and create an OAuth Client ID for a Desktop App named "gmail".
2. Save these credentials as `credentials_gmail.json` in the `tokens` folder.

### Step 3: Configure Google Drive API
1. Create an OAuth Client ID for a Web application named "GDrive".
2. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to `pydrive_setting.yaml` in the `tokens` folder.

### Step 4: Service Account for Google Sheets
1. Create a service account and share your Google Sheet with it.
2. Save the credentials as `credentials_sheets.json` in the `tokens` folder.

### Step 5: Google Apps Script
1. Copy the Google Apps Script into your own file.
2. Insert the internal sheets ID into the script.
3. Set up a trigger to run the script daily.

### Step 6: Configuration File
You can customize the functionality of the program. A more detailed look can be found below.
1. Under Google Drive, Folder ID: Put the folder ID of the Google Drive where the PDFs will be placed.
2. Under Google Sheets, Sheet ID: Put the Sheet ID of the internal database sheet.
3. Under WhatsApp, Group ID: Put the WhatsApp Group ID, where the messages will be send here.

## Google Drive Folder Structure
- Two sheets: an internal version for data processing and a public version.
- Customize as needed; the public version is preformatted for IFMSA-NL use.
- [Access the folder here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PtnCCO9G2ouEJ_F30BNIOzhu37pgPJbn?usp=share_link).

## Emojis
- Use emoji shortcodes in WhatsApp, starting with a colon `:`. 
- [Find the full list of shortcodes here](https://gist.github.com/hkan/264423ab0ee720efb55e05a0f5f90887).
- Example: `:hour\t` for ‚è∞.

## Program Behavior
- Marks emails as read after processing to handle only unread emails. You can change this, but it might affect functionality.

## Known Issues and Fixes
- **WhatsApp Database Error**: Extend load time in the config.
- **PDFs Missing Images**: Trying to fix this.
- **Incorrect Deadline Selection**: AI extraction may occasionally miss deadlines.
- **WhatsApp Web logging out**: Sadly I cannot fix this, for this I recommend either checking it beforehand or if you're running it on a server, not closing the WhatsApp Web instance

## Note
Currently, the program supports WhatsApp only. Telegram integration is in progress! You can turn off the WhatsApp functionality


# Config overview
Every part of the config can be changed. Here is an overview of what is in there and what it does.

- **Gmail**

    - **query**: The Query in which the program will look for messages. I recommend always using unread, as otherwise the program will redo the messages everytime. Default: `label:Database in:unread`

- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**
    
    Note: it will only use the NLP/AI when it cannot find a deadline in the email subject. The NLPs come from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co). Here you can also find different models.
    - **deadline_purpose**: Enables the NLP to answer a question. Default: `question-answering`
    - **deadline_model**: What model the Deadline NLP uses. Default: `deepset/roberta-base-squad2`
    - **deadline_question**: = Poses a question to the NLP. Default: `What is the deadline?`
    - **summarization_purpose**: = What the purpose of the summarization is. Default: `summarization`
    - **summarization_model**: = What model the summarization NLP uses. Default: `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6`

- **Google Drive**

    - **pdf_file_path**: Where the PDF is temporarily stored. Default: `temp.pdf`
    - **html_file_path**: Where the HTML is temporarily stored. Default: `temp.html`
    - **file_name**: What the name of the PDF will be. Default: `Deadline: ${deadline} | Subject: ${email_subject}`
    - **folder_id**: What is the Google Drive folder ID where the PDFs will be stored. No default value.

- **Google Sheets**

    - **sheet_ID**: What is the Google Sheet ID where the opportunities will be solved. No default value.

- **WhatsApp**

    - **send_whatsapp**: If a WhatsApp should be send. If turned off, no WhatsApp will be send. Can be either `True` or `False`. Default: `True`
    - **group_id**: What is the Group ID of the WhatsApp group in which the opporunties will be shared. No default value
    - **message** What the WhatsApp Message will be. You can use Emojis as described in the ReadMe. Emojis always start with `:` and end with a `\t`. Default: 

    ```
    :laun\t *Exciting Opportunity Alert!* :laun\t

    :tear-\t On _${email_date} GMT_ an email was sent by _${email_sender}_ about a new exciting opportunity!
    
    :gli\t *Opportunity Description:*
    _${email_summary}_

    :hour\t *Deadline:*
    _${deadline}_ | (Note: if this is a combined call there may be multiple deadlines)
    
    :link\t *Find out the details by following the link!* :mail\t
    ${file_link}
    
    :meri\t Missed something? Check out the International Database in the group description!
    
    :rob\t _I am an automated message, and sometimes I make a little mistake, please correct me if I do :)_

## On the usage of variables in the config

There are a few variables that can be used in the config. These are marked by using `${}`. the following variables exist:
    
    ${deadline}, ${email_subject}, ${email_date}, ${email_sender}, ${email_summary}, ${file_link}
